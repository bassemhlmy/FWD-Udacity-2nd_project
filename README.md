# No-Show Appointments Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of medical appointments to investigate factors that influence whether patients show up for their appointments. The goal is to identify trends, visualize data, and build models to predict no-shows, helping healthcare providers improve appointment scheduling efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about patients' appointments such as:
- Appointment date
- Patient ID
- Age
- Gender
- Scheduled day
- Appointment day
- Status (Show/No-show)
- Other factors (Scholarship, SMS reminders, etc.)

## Objectives
- Explore the dataset to uncover patterns affecting appointment attendance.
- Visualize the relationships between key variables.
- Develop predictive models to forecast patient no-shows.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and transformation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models for prediction.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for analysis.

## Key Findings
- Analyzed how age, gender, and reminders influence no-shows.
- Created visualizations to depict trends and distributions.
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.) to predict no-shows.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by tuning hyperparameters.
- Consider additional features to enhance predictions.
- Deploy the model in a web-based tool for healthcare providers.
